# Simulations of many neutrinos

Simulations of dense neutrino gases, mostly in the OILE model.

## A check of the analytical solution to eq. 19 of the current draft paper is carried out in notebooks/2024_1_4_eq_19_check.ipynb.

The dynamics of the OILE model are implemented in approach2/dynamics.py.

approach2/take_data.py is the script currently used for taking data, which has been plotted using notebooks/approach_2_multivacuum_2.ipynb.
